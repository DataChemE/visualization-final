# NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing motor vehicle collision data in New York City for the years 2021-2023. Utilizing the Altair visualization library in Python, the project aims to clean, summarize, and visually represent crash data in a user-friendly and insightful manner.

## Data Source
The dataset, sourced from the NYC Open Data portal, includes comprehensive details on motor vehicle collisions in NYC, covering various attributes such as date/time, borough, zip code, latitude/longitude, injuries/fatalities, contributing factors, and vehicle types.

## Key Features
- **Time Series Analysis:** Analyzes trends over time, including hours of the day, days of the week, and monthly patterns.
- **Incident Attribute Counts:** Aggregates data by various attributes such as injuries, boroughs, and vehicle types.
- **Word Cloud:** Visualizes common contributing factors to accidents.
- **Borough Filtering:** Allows users to filter data by borough, enabling localized analysis.

## User Feedback and Refinements
Feedback from non-expert users played a crucial role in refining the visualizations:

### Findings & Refinements
- **Chart Labeling:** Standardized axis labels across charts for uniformity and clarity.
- **Heatmap Coloring:** Improved the color scheme of the heatmap for better clarity and visual appeal.
- **Word Cloud Density:** Retained the word cloud in its existing form but educated users about its typical appearance and purpose.
- **Filtering by Borough:** Users appreciated the ability to filter data by borough, which enhanced localized data analysis.
- **Tooltip Formatting:** Adjusted tooltips for consistency and clearer formatting.

### Overall Impact
These refinements led to a more user-friendly and informative data visualization experience, enhancing both the visual appeal and the interpretability of the data.
